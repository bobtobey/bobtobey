From a UX perspective, these are not just usability issues. They create stress and can increase the risk of errors during sensitive, time-critical moments.

                                    <p>
                                        In the realm of insurance, First Notice of Loss (FNOL) is the initial report made by a policyholder to their insurance company, notifying them of an incident or event that may lead to a claim. This notification typically includes essential details about the incident, such as the date, time, location, and nature of the loss or damage, as well as information about any involved parties and witnesses. FNOL is the first step in the claims process, initiating the insurer's response and investigation into the reported event.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="portfolio-summary">
                                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        UX research, surveys, and direct user feedback revealed that the FNOL experience was clunky and disorienting. Users faced a complex entry process with little visual feedback or indication of progress, leading to stress, second-guessing, and inefficiency during a critical, high-pressure task.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        They needed a smoother, more supportive interface, one that integrated better with surrounding systems, guided users visually, and adapted to how they actually worked.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The challenge was to reimagine the application as something transparent, intuitive, and reassuring—an experience that reduced friction and supported users through every step of the claims process.

                                        The goal was to streamline the FNOL process, improving both efficiency and user experience. A comprehensive UX design process was followed, including in-depth research, persona development, user journey mapping, design, and prototyping. Changes were introduced thoughtfully to align with existing user expectations while ensuring a practical, user-centered solution for the insurance software landscape.

                                        Through qualitative interviews, quantitative analytics, and surveys the goal was to gain valuable insights from key stakeholders and users, ensuring a wide range of perspectives.

The initial focus is on a primary, aggregated persona for the MVP, with secondary personas planned for future iterations. These personas reflect the core traits and needs of a Claims Intake Specialist, ensuring a user-centered approach to the design.

This basic journey map outlines each phase of the process, capturing both the pain points and emotional journey experienced.
